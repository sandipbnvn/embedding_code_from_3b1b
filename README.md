# README for `embedding_code.ipynb`

## Overview

This project explores embeddings and their visualizations using high-dimensional vectors. The notebook demonstrates how to compute distances and similarities between vectors and includes examples of visualizing vector relationships with heatmaps. The code is organized into distinct sections for clarity and reusability.
