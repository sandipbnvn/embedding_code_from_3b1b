## Overview

This project explores embeddings and their visualizations using high-dimensional vectors. The notebook demonstrates how to compute distances and similarities between vectors and includes examples of visualizing vector relationships with heatmaps. The code is organized into distinct sections for clarity and reusability.

## Prerequisites

### Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.11 or later
- Key Python libraries used:
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations and handling vectors.
  - `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations like heatmaps.
  - `seaborn`: For enhanced heatmap visualization.

### Installation
Make sure the required libraries are installed:
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn


## Sections in the Notebook

### 1. **Vector Representation**
- Demonstrates how high-dimensional vectors are defined.
- Includes examples of vectors representing different entities like `man`, `woman`, `uncle`, etc.

### 2. **Distance and Similarity Metrics**
- Functions are provided to compute:
  - Euclidean distance
  - Cosine similarity
- Examples demonstrate their application on vector pairs, showcasing numerical results.

### 3. **Visualization**
- **Heatmaps:** Visualizes relationships between vectors using color-coded matrices.
  - Utilizes Seaborn's `heatmap` for better readability.
  - Includes annotated labels and customizable color maps.

### 4. **Dynamic Embedding Comparison**
- Stack and compare multiple vectors dynamically.
- Visualization provides a clear comparison of vector magnitudes and patterns.


## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Set Up Vector Data:**
   - Define your own vectors or use the provided sample vectors.
   - Ensure all vectors have the same dimensionality.

2. **Calculate Metrics:**
   - Use the included functions to compute distances and similarities between vectors.

3. **Generate Visualizations:**
   - Run the visualization cells to plot heatmaps or analyze vector relationships graphically.

## Example Output

1. **Computed Metrics:**
   - Displays similarity or distance values for the defined vectors.

2. **Heatmap Visualization:**
   - Shows a color-coded heatmap of vector values or their relationships.

## File Details

- **`embedding_code.ipynb`:** Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and outputs.

## Extensions
The notebook can be extended to:
- Include other similarity or distance measures (e.g., Manhattan distance).
- Work with embeddings generated by popular ML models (e.g., word embeddings or sentence embeddings).

## Notes
Ensure all dependencies are installed, and run the notebook in an environment like Jupyter or Google Colab for the best experience.
